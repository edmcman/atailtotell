Since our goal is to find a safe and happy forever home for every dog, we appreciate your understanding should you be eliminated as an adoption candidate.<\/p>\n<h5><small>Step<\/small>3<\/h5>\n<h3>Veterinary Reference Check<\/h3>\n<p>A volunteer at <strong>A Tail To Tell<\/strong> will verify your veterinarian as listed on your application to ensure that your current pets are up-to-date on vaccinations and spayed\/neutered (we will not place one of our dogs in a home where there is another intact animal). If you do not have a pet, we will verify that the vet you have selected exists.<\/p>\n<h5><small>Step<\/small>4<\/h5>\n<h3>Phone or Email Interview<\/h3>\n<p>A foster parent will contact you directly to conduct a phone interview consisting of questions about you, your family, your home and other scenarios to determine a suitable match, if any, for your home. This typically occurs within a two to three week period of time but can happen sooner or later.<\/p>\n<h5><small>Step<\/small>5<\/h5>\n<h3>Home Visit<\/h3>\n<p>The final step of the approval process is a home visit. A home visit is when a volunteer comes to your home to determine if it is safe and acceptable for a small dog. Home visits will be set up by <strong>A Tail To Tell<\/strong>. <strong>A Tail To Tell<\/strong> will attempt to find a volunteer to conduct the home visit. This could take days or weeks. Please be patient with us. We are all volunteers.<\/p>\n<h5><small>Step<\/small>6<\/h5>\n<h3>Adopt<\/h3>\n<p>Once you have completed and passed the home visit, you are ready to adopt one of our dogs.<\/p>\n<h2>\n\t\tAdoption Donations\n\t<\/h2>\n\t<p>A Tail to Tell adoption donations help us pay for the best care for our dogs, including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Spaying and neutering<\/li>\n<li>Full bloodwork<\/li>\n<li>Testing for tick-borne diseases<\/li>\n<li>Dental examination and treatment<\/li>\n<li>Microchip implantation and registration<\/li>\n<li>Rabies vaccine<\/li>\n<li>DHLPP vaccine<\/li>\n<li>Bordatella vaccine<\/li>\n<li>Any other issues addressed before adoption<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>A Tail to Tell adoption donations are based on the age of the dog being adopted, as shown below:<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<h2>16 Weeks To 3 Years<\/h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t$500\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li><\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/ul>\n\t\t\t<a href=\"\" target=\"_self\" role=\"button\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGet Started\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<br \/>\n\t\t\t\t<h2>4 Years To 7 Years<\/h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t$375\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li><\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/ul>\n\t\t\t<a href=\"\" target=\"_self\" role=\"button\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGet Started\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<br \/>\n\t\t\t\t<h2>8 Years or Older<\/h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t$250\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li><\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/ul>\n\t\t\t<a href=\"\" target=\"_self\" role=\"button\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGet Started\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<br \/>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>How To Adopt a Rescued Dog Adopting from our rescue requires that you complete ALL of the steps in our adoption process outlined below.
