Foster homes are the most crucial yet challenging ingredient to our rescue efforts. Without available foster homes, many dogs are unable to be rescued. However with foster homes, each dog is provided a nurturing home environment that includes food, shelter, exercise, and, most importantly, love. These animals come to understand that the safest place in the world is in the arms of their caretakers. Once the dog is ready, she or he is adopted into a thoroughly screened, caring, and permanent home.<\/p>\n<p>We educate the public on what commercial breeding facilities entail, ways to prevent enabling these facilities from continuing, alternative ways to adopt a dog and the correct and moral way to care for their animals, including the importance of spaying and neutering pets to help stop the flow of abandoned and unwanted animals in our community.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Foster a Puppy Mill Dog Our family foster home system provides a safe haven for dogs used in commercial breeding facilities.
