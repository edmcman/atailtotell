The volunteers in this group work tirelessly to raise money to rescue rehabilitate and provide outstanding veterinary care to any dog that is rescued from a puppy mill. This group was formed 18 years ago when a small group of people saw the need for a rescue group in Pennsylvania to rescue dogs living in substandard conditions in the puppy mills. Since its inception the group has grown but the primary goal of this group has remained the same &#8211; to rescue rehabilitate and provide outstanding veterinary care to any dog rescued from a puppy mill.<\/p>\n<h4>\n\t\tWe will be there to pick up the broken pieces\n\t<\/h4>\n\t<p>10 years ago we really thought we would be rescuing dogs for a couple years and then we truly believed that the politicians in the state of Pennsylvania would put an end to the horrors inside these kennels. Sadly the laws have been changed but they are not being enforced and 10 years later we are still fighting the same battle. We don&#8217;t know what it&#8217;s going to take to put a stop to the neglect and mistreatment of these wonderful canine friends but what we do know is this: Until the last dog is freed and all the puppy mills are closed A Tail to Tell will be there to pick up the broken pieces of these Innocent victims of mans greed.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/atailtotell.wpengine.com\/contact\/\" target=\"_self\" role=\"button\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tContact Us\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Who is A Tail To Tell?
